Programming Technique 1 (C++)

During this course, I have learned my first programming language which is C++. I have learned about algorithm, control structures, data structures, functions and error-handling. Although it was not an easy language for me, I am able to learned other programming languages easily by myself as I already grasped the basic of the programming language thanks to C++. This course allows me to build up my problem-solving skills and critical thinking skills. As for the improvement, I hope that students get a summary for each topics that they have learned during this course as it will save their times to refer back to the notes.
